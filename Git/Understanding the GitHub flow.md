Understanding the GitHub flow

GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. This guide explains how and why GitHub flow works.

### Create a branch

When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time -- some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.

When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch don't affect the `master` branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.

#### ProTip

Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub flow is based upon it. There's only one rule: anything in the `master` branch is always deployable.

Because of this, it's extremely important that your new branch is created off of master when working on a feature or a fix. Your branch name should be descriptive (e.g., `refactor-authentication`, `user-content-cache-key`, `make-retina-avatars`), so that others can see what is being worked on.
